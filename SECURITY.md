## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately using [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/tjhanley/spud/security/advisories/new). This ensures the issue can be assessed and patched before public disclosure.

When reporting, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected crate(s) and version/commit
- Impact assessment (if known)

You can expect an initial response within 7 days. If the vulnerability is accepted, a fix will be prioritized and released as soon as practical with a coordinated disclosure.
